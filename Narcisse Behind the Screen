Narcisse Behind the Screen by J. Vesper

Chapter 1

I’ve always known I had the kind of body that made strangers look twice.
Broad shoulders, sculpted abs — the whole catalogue of things people assume I must have worked obsessively for. And yes, I did work for it, but sometimes even I’m surprised by the way my reflection hits me, like I’m seeing myself through someone else’s eyes. My skin holds that warm, sun-kissed tone even in winter; I’ve heard people say it looks like I’m permanently returning from a holiday I never took. My arms carry that quiet force — the kind I pretend not to notice, even though part of me is painfully aware of how much people read into it.
My face… well, it echoes the same intensity. Sharp cheekbones, a jawline that always looks a bit too firm in photos, eyes that catch everything even when I wish they didn’t. I’ve been told I look like I’m analysing a room instead of just standing in it. They’re not wrong. And the hair — always a little messy, never quite intentional, yet somehow it falls into place. I don’t understand it, but I’ve stopped fighting it.
Every movement I make feels deliberate, even when I’m not trying. Sometimes I wonder if I’ve trained myself into that precision without realising it — like a predator who can’t turn off the instinct to track, measure, dominate space.
People say there’s something magnetic about me. I pretend I don’t hear it, but of course I do. Part discipline, part confidence, part… something wilder underneath. Something I’m not sure I fully control. Maybe that’s why people stare. Maybe that’s why sometimes they look away too quickly.

But the truth is this: if my presence in real life is striking, online I become something else entirely.
Instagram is my real territory. Not the gym, not the bars, not the streets.
No — the camera. The lens. That rectangle of light where I can sculpt myself into the version of me I wish existed.
Behind the screen, I’m perfect. Untouchable. Incandescent.
A masterpiece.

I spend hours crafting it — the angle, the shadow, the way morning light cuts across my chest just right. I adjust the lamp until the Clair Obscur makes me look both softer and sharper at once. I tilt the phone, a degree here, a centimetre there, chasing the exact contour I want people to fall for.
And I tell myself it’s just aesthetics… but I know better.
What people don’t understand — what I don’t even like admitting to myself — is that this carefully curated world is more than vanity.
It’s my refuge.
My sanctuary.
The only place where nothing feels off-balance.
Because real intimacy… real bodies, real encounters… they’ve always ended up disappointing me.
It’s not that I’ve lacked opportunities. I know the effect I have on people. I can feel their excitement when things begin — and their unease when they realise the intensity they wanted is more than they can hold.
My presence overwhelms. My stamina exhausts.
I ask for too much without saying a word.
I hate admitting that.
I hate feeling like I need to shrink myself to fit someone else’s comfort.
I hate the moment when I see their expression shift — curiosity turning to hesitation.
It always ends the same way: a kind of quiet disappointment neither of us names.
Over time, I started associating real life with frustration.
With being misunderstood.
With being too much for the world I’m supposed to inhabit.

Chapter 2

I remember one night in particular, a date that started with sparks and ended in the same dull ache of frustration. She was striking (petite, but every inch of her radiated confidence and raw sexiness). Her face hit me first: high cheekbones, full lips curling into a teasing smile, dark eyes that looked straight through me and dared me to keep up. Her hair fell in soft waves against her jaw and neck, framing that delicate, dangerous strength in her expression. Even in her small, graceful frame there was a coiled tension when she moved (subtle curves, poised shoulders, a sway that promised both play and punishment). She was compact, magnetic, impossible to look away from.
Over dinner she leaned in close, her perfume a warm floral whisper mixing with the food, her fingers brushing slow, deliberate trails along my forearm. Her eyes glittered with wicked intent when she dropped her voice. “I remember what you told me online,” she said, lips curving. “That you’re insatiable. That you can go all night. I’m dying to find out if you’re telling the truth.” The words hung heavy between us, dripping with promise. Every syllable tasted like sin, and when her hand settled possessively on my arm the jolt shot straight through my body, tightening everything below my belt.
By the time the untouched chocolate lava cake sat abandoned between us, the rest of the restaurant had vanished. The cab ride home was pure torture; the second the door shut behind us she pressed her whole body against mine, hand sliding up the inside of my thigh without hesitation. Her fingers traced the hard line of my erection through my trousers, slow and maddening. “Hmm,” she purred against my ear, hot breath making me shiver. “Someone’s eager. Let’s see how long you last.” The city lights blurred outside, but all I felt was the steady roll of her hips against me as the cab crawled through traffic.
Inside my apartment the air turned thick and humid the moment the door closed. She spun in my arms, fisted her hands in my hair, and dragged my mouth down to hers (all teeth, tongue, raw need). She broke away gasping, eyes predatory as she raked her gaze over me. “I want you to fuck me,” she said, voice low and rough. “Hard. Don’t hold back. I want to see if you can actually break me.” She was a dare in human form, and I was already too far gone to do anything but accept.
I looked at her, voice scraped raw. “You sure you want this?”
Her breath caught; a ghost of a smile flickered. “I’ve never been more sure of anything,” she whispered. “Show me. Don’t you dare hold back.” Those dark, blown-wide eyes begged louder than her words. I groaned, low and guttural, and crushed my mouth to hers, kissing her like I wanted to bruise her, tongue intensely deep, claiming every inch. My hands mapped her body (waist, hips, ass) like I was memorizing territory that already belonged to me.
I pulled back just enough to drag my mouth down her throat. “You feel so fucking good,” I rasped against her skin, teeth scraping her collarbone. “So soft. So mine.” My fingers hooked the lace edge of her panties. “I’m going to take you now, so hard you won’t walk straight tomorrow. Tell me that’s what you want.”
She could only nod, words lost in the heat rolling off me.
I tore her panties off (fabric ripping with a sharp, satisfying snap) and pinned her to the bed with my weight. Settling between her thighs, I dragged the thick head of my cock through her slick folds, coating myself in how wet she already was. “Gosh, you’re soaked for me,” I growled, smug and hungry. “You want this cock inside you, don’t you?”
I didn’t wait. One hard thrust and I buried myself to the hilt. She choked out a broken gasp, head falling back as her body stretched around me, that perfect tight burn blooming into pleasure.
“Damn,” I groaned, forehead pressed to hers. “So tight. So goddamn tight.” I started slow, dragging out almost all the way before slamming back in, every thrust deeper, harder, claiming her completely.
She clung to me, nails raking down my back, overwhelmed by how huge I felt inside her, how every stroke stretched her to the limit and still left her desperate for more.

I settled my hips between her trembling thighs, the fat, swollen head of my cock nudging insistently against her slick, dripping entrance. She was so wet I could feel it coating me already, hot and slippery, begging. No more teasing, no more waiting. I pushed forward (slow, deliberate, merciless), watching every inch of her face as her tight little cunt stretched around me. A choked, desperate gasp tore from her throat, her head falling back hard against the pillows while I fed her every thick, unrelenting inch. The burn was exquisite; I could feel her walls fluttering, fighting, then finally yielding as I sank deeper and deeper until my balls pressed flush against her ass and I was buried to the fucking hilt inside her.
I ground my pelvis hard against her clit, rolling slow and cruel, and she whimpered (high, broken, perfect). I stayed there, unmoving, letting her feel exactly how completely owned she was in that moment, letting her pussy throb and clench around the invasion.
Then I started to move.
Every withdrawal was torture for both of us; I dragged out slow, so slow she clawed at my back, trying to pull me back in, her cunt sucking greedily at my shaft like it couldn’t bear the emptiness. Every thrust was a brutal, possessive claim (hips snapping forward, slamming home so deep the bedframe groaned and her entire body jolted). I set a punishing, relentless rhythm, the kind that had her clinging to my shoulders, nails carving red lines down my back, her soaked pussy making obscene wet sounds with every stroke. The room was nothing but the slap of my balls against her ass, her desperate cries, my guttural groans as I fucked her like I wanted to split her in half.
I hooked one of her legs high over my forearm, opened her wide, changed the angle, and suddenly I was pounding directly into that spot that made her lose her mind. Her eyes rolled back, her spine arched clean off the mattress, and a violent, screaming orgasm ripped through her (her cunt clamped down so hard I had to fight to keep moving, milking my cock in hot, pulsing waves while she shook and sobbed beneath me).
I didn’t stop. If anything, her coming all over me made me fuck her harder, deeper, more erratic. I was possessed (lost in the slick heat gripping me, the way her body yielded so perfectly). She surrendered completely, eagerly, her cunt no longer her own but mine to ruin. The pleasure in her turned sharp, almost too intense, pleasure and pain blurring until I could feel her teetering on the edge of breaking.
And just when I felt her start to fracture, I slammed in one last time (balls drawn tight, spine on fire) and came with a hoarse, animal shout, pumping rope after thick rope of come deep inside her, marking her from the inside out, claiming every inch of that tight, spasming cunt.
But it wasn’t over. Not even close.
I barely softened before the hunger roared back, my cock thickening again inside her soaked, come-filled pussy. She felt it (felt me swelling, stretching her all over again) and gasped against my sweat-slick shoulder, voice trembling with disbelief.
“Oh God… you’re still hard. You’re still fucking hard.”
A low, possessive laugh rumbled out of me. “Told you we’re not done. Not by a long shot.”
I rolled us in one smooth, powerful move and suddenly she was on top, still impaled, my come and hers dripping down my shaft and over my balls. The shift dragged a fresh, oversensitive cry from her throat. My hands clamped onto her hips (fingers digging bruises into soft flesh) and I growled, “Ride me. Take what you need.”
There was no gentleness left in me. I entered into her from below, using my grip to lift her and slam her down hard onto my cock, over and over, controlling every brutal stroke. Her second orgasm hit like a seizure (sudden, violent); she screamed, back arching, cunt clamping down again as she came a second time, gushing around me.
She collapsed forward, limp and shaking, but I didn’t let her rest. I held her in place and kept pounding up into her oversensitive body, forcing her to feel every inch through the aftershocks.
“That’s it,” I snarled, voice ragged. “Take it. Take this cock like you were made for it.”
She tried to shift, to ease the intensity, but my grip turned iron. “Don’t you fucking pull away,” I warned, low and dangerous.
The sounds she made now were wrecked (half pleas, half sobs), pleasure so intense it bordered on agony. I flipped her again, shoved her face-first into the mattress, yanked her hips up high until her back arched perfectly.
“I’m not done with this greedy little cunt,” I growled, lining up and slamming back in.
From this angle I felt even bigger; every thrust drove deeper than before, the head of my cock kissing her core, punching the air from her lungs. The mattress screamed beneath us, the headboard battering the wall in a frantic, animal rhythm.
She shattered completely. Pleasure dissolved into pure, overwhelming sensation (no words, no thoughts, just the endless, brutal reaming of her swollen, come-soaked pussy). And still I wasn’t close. The need in me was bottomless.
Then, finally, a raw, desperate whisper: “Stop.”
I didn’t hear it at first. I was too deep in the red haze (world narrowed to the slick, clutching heat around my cock, the power surging through me, the release that stayed just out of reach). I fucked her harder, hips pistoning, chasing it, a feral growl building in my chest as her body went completely pliant beneath me, no longer pushing back, only taking.
“Please,” she sobbed, voice shredded raw. “I can’t… I can’t anymore.”
That word (please) finally sliced through.
I froze, buried to the balls, chest heaving, every muscle coiled and trembling. My cock jerked angrily inside her, denied, aching. The sudden silence was deafening. Frustration crashed over me like a wave (bitter, vicious, animal).
With a shuddering breath that tasted like pure aggravation, I pulled out (slow, torturous inches of swollen, come-slick shaft dragging free). The loss was a hollow, brutal ache. I rolled away and collapsed onto my back, staring at the ceiling while my jaw clenched so hard it hurt. My cock stood rigid against my stomach (veins throbbing, head flushed dark and leaking), pulsing in time with the furious beat of my heart. I was a live wire, vibrating with unspent come and nowhere to put it.
She lay beside me trembling, utterly spent (breath hitching, thighs twitching, pussy gaping and glistening with my come and hers). I couldn’t look at her. If I saw how thoroughly I’d ruined her while I stayed this hard, this painfully unsatisfied, I’d lose the last shred of control I had.
I left that night exactly the way I always leave: cock aching, balls heavy and untouched, body screaming for a release that never quite comes, silently cursing the way I’m wired (able to fuck for hours, ready again the second I finish, never fully sated), another brutal reminder that what I need and what any woman can actually take are two entirely different things.

Chapter 3

Too many nights ended exactly like that (her trembling beneath me, spent and pleading, while I was still hard, aching, and nowhere near finished).
I told myself every time would be different. I really believed it.
There was Camille, the willowy poet I met at a gallery opening. Her apartment smelled of turpentine, old paper, and red wine. She laughed like wind chimes while Coltrane spun on an ancient turntable. She kissed me like she’d been starving for it, peeled my shirt off with eager fingers, whispered filthy poetry against my throat. Ten minutes in I had her legs over my shoulders, driving into her slow and deep, the bedframe knocking out a steady rhythm against the wall. She went from arching and moaning to suddenly pushing at my chest, eyes wide.
“Wait… wait, please,” she gasped, that nervous little laugh cracking her voice. “You’re… God, you’re too much.”
And just like that the fire went out of her. She lay there soft and pliant, apologizing with her eyes while my cock throbbed inside her, furious and untouched. I pulled out, kissed her forehead like a gentleman, and jerked off in her bathroom so hard my vision blurred, hating the sound of my own frustrated groan echoing off the tiles.
Then there was Mara, the rugby player. Six feet of muscle and confidence, thighs that could crush a man, a grip that made me think finally, finally someone could take it. She tore my clothes off in her loft, shoved me down, rode me like she was trying to win a medal. Round one she matched me thrust for thrust. Round two she was still grinning. Round three I flipped her onto her stomach, pinned her wrists, and fucked her so hard the headboard left dents in the wall. Her “don’t stop” turned into a breathless “okay, okay, slow down, I can’t—” and her powerful body went limp under me, trembling, finished. I came in the shower again that night, forehead pressed to the cold tile, jaw clenched so tight it hurt.
Sophie, the lawyer with the razor tongue and the penthouse view, lasted the longest. She rode me on her designer couch, nails raking my chest, telling me exactly how she wanted it. When I picked her up, slammed her against the floor-to-ceiling window, and fucked her until the glass fogged, she shattered beautifully… then immediately apologized, legs shaking, sliding down my body like melted wax. “I’m sorry, I just… I can’t,” she whispered, while I stood there dripping with her and still rigid, the city lights mocking me from thirty stories below.
Every single time ended the same way: me pretending to be understanding, kissing them goodnight, then jerking off alone, angry, unsatisfied, hating the way my body refused to quit when everything in me wanted to just be fucking normal.

So I gave up on flesh and turned to pixels.
Online, I controlled everything. The pace. The angle. The finish. No one tapped out. No one looked at me with that mix of awe and fear. No one left me aching.
I built a whole gallery of myself for them.
My favorite was the black-and-white one: me on my back in low light, drizzling warm oil across my chest and abs, dragging my palms slow over every ridge and valley while the camera watched like a lover who would never get tired. I’d tease myself for them (fingers tracing lower, wrapping around my cock, stroking lazy at first, then faster, hips lifting off the bed, breath hitching until my whole body locked and I came in long, thick pulses across my stomach, groaning their names even though I didn’t know them yet).
I uploaded slow, intimate clips (leaning in close to the lens like I was whispering secrets, lips almost brushing the glass, voice low and rough). I sent shirtless mirror shots, videos of my hand moving under the waistband of loose sweats, teasing glimpses of the bulge they all begged to see.
The DMs flooded in.
“Fuck, I’d let you ruin me.”
“I’ve never wanted anyone this much.”
“Please, please let me watch you come again.”
“I rode my partner last night imagining it was you”
Some sent videos back (fingers buried in soaked panties, toys disappearing inside them while they moaned my name). Some begged to fly to me. Some offered money, marriage, anything.
For a while it felt like power. It felt like worship.
Then the likes started tasting like ash. The “you’re so hot” messages blurred together. The videos I made for them stopped making me hard before I even hit record.
I’d still perform (because that’s what it was now, a performance), oil still gleaming, muscles still flexing, cock still thick and heavy in my fist, but the rush was gone. I’d come hard, body shaking, come streaking hot across my skin… and feel nothing upstairs. Just a hollow clench in my chest, a dull gray fog where the triumph used to be.

I started calling them “sad orgasms.” My body obeyed perfectly (still does), but the signal never reached my brain. No euphoria, no release, just the mechanical spill of come and the same heavy silence afterward.
Mornings got harder. The bed felt like quicksand. Coffee tasted like nothing. Meetings were underwater. I’d laugh at jokes and hear how fake it sounded. My apartment filled with unopened mail, take-out boxes, clothes on the floor. I moved through the city like a ghost in my own skin (visible, touchable, but not really there).
The camera still loved me. Thousands of women still swore they’d die happy if I fucked them senseless.
But the truth is, none of them (real or digital) have ever reached the place inside me that actually needs to be touched.
And every night, after I come for an audience that will never get enough and I still want more, I lie in the dark staring at the ceiling, cock finally soft, chest aching with something heavier than lust, and wonder if this is just what I am now: a machine that can perform forever and feel nothing at all.

Chapter 4

It was one of those heavy, gray evenings (the kind where the city outside my window felt muffled and the air in my apartment tasted stale) when I was scrolling through the same recycled praise: “daddy,” “god,” “ruin me,” “marry me,” “I’d let you do anything.” The words blurred into static. That’s when her message slid into my DMs like a scalpel.
Eléareads.
Profile picture: nothing but stacked books and deep shadow.
No face, no body, no thirst-trap selfie. Just text.
She hadn’t written “you’re so hot.”
She hadn’t even mentioned my cock.
She wrote three long paragraphs about the chiaroscuro in my last black-and-white video: how I instinctively used negative space, how the light fell across my ribs like a confession, how the framing was “almost masterful but still a little sentimental.” She called my use of shadow “hungry but undisciplined.”
I stared at the screen and felt something I hadn’t felt in years: irritation that tasted like blood in my mouth. Who the fuck was this woman to critique me like I was some first-year art student? I reread it three times, hunting for the hidden compliment, the part where she finally admitted my body made her wet. There was nothing. Just cool, precise observation. It pissed me off more than I wanted to admit. And yet I couldn’t stop rereading it.
I answered anyway. Sharper than usual. Defensive.
She replied within minutes, unruffled, slicing through every layer of bravado I threw up like it was tissue paper.
That was the beginning.
Our conversations grew slowly at first (long paragraphs traded like chess moves). She never gushed, never begged, never sent me a photo of her tits. She asked questions that made me feel flayed open:
“Why do you always tilt the camera down in the last ten seconds?”
“What are you trying not to look at when you come for them?”
“What scares you more: being wanted or being truly seen?”
I answered with an honesty that startled me. Things I had never said out loud, not to lovers, not to therapists, not even to myself. She caught every hesitation, every half-truth, and turned it gently in her fingers until I saw the shape of it. Her mind moved over mine the way no hand ever had (slow, deliberate, merciless, intimate). I started hearing her voice when I read her words: low, slightly amused, a little dangerous. I started imagining her breath against my ear when she typed “…” before sending something particularly cutting.
The hunger shifted.
It wasn’t about being desired anymore. It was about being understood (and the terrifying, exhilarating possibility that someone could understand me and still want me).
Night after night I lay in the dark, iPad glowing, pulse thudding so hard I could feel it in my throat, my cock, the soles of my feet. This wasn’t the quick, predictable heat I was used to. This was deeper, electric, relentless. My body reacted with a ferocity I hadn’t felt in years (hard almost instantly, aching for hours, refusing to calm even after I came). I’d finish twice, three times, and still feel wired, restless, like her words had rewired the circuitry of desire itself. I’d be shaking, sweating, half-mad by dawn, and her next message would land and the surge would start all over again (sharper, meaner, impossible to ignore).
Then one night she sent the puzzle.
“I want you to describe yourself without using your body. Convince me who you are when the camera is off.”
I stared at those words until they burned.
No one had ever stripped the armor off me like that. I was used to being chased, worshipped, feared. Now this faceless woman was setting the rules, and I was the one scrambling to prove I existed beneath the muscle and the light and the performance.
I typed, deleted, typed again. My hands shook.
I wrote about the silence after I come for an audience that will never be enough. I wrote about the mornings when even coffee tastes like ash. I wrote about the fear that I’m only the sum of what I can make hard, what I can make scream, what I can outlast. I hit send and felt naked in a way no nude video had ever left me.
She replied in under a minute (calm, surgical, devastating).
She quoted my own sentences back to me, turned them inside out, showed me the parts I’d tried to hide even from myself. And instead of humiliation, I felt… seen. Raw, trembling, painfully alive.
The games escalated.
Write about a memory without naming the person in it.
Describe shame without dressing it up as pride.
Tell me a desire you’re afraid to admit out loud.
Each task looked innocent. Each one gutted me.
And every time I bled on the page for her, my body responded like she’d wrapped her hand around my cock and squeezed (hard instantly, leaking, aching in ways that scared me).
She started playing with timing.
Sometimes she answered in seconds. Sometimes she left me hanging for six hours. Every minute of silence twisted the knife. I’d refresh like an addict, heart slamming against my ribs, cock half-hard just from the anticipation of her next sentence.
I realized, with a jolt that left me breathless, that I had never been seduced like this (never been taken apart word by word, neuron by neuron, until I couldn’t tell where intellect ended and arousal began).
Then, weeks in, after a night when I’d written something so vulnerable I almost deleted it before sending, she wrote:
“Let’s meet. No screens. Just us.”
I stared at the message until the letters blurred.
My pulse roared in my ears. My body reacted the way it always does (instant, brutal erection), but underneath it was something new: terror. Real, stomach-dropping fear.
Because for the first time, none of my usual weapons would work.
She had never seen me fully naked. She didn’t know how big I am, how long I last, how easily I can make a woman come apart.
She only knew the parts of me I had never shown anyone else (the fear, the hollow places, the shame I usually bury under muscle and control).
If I walked into that room, I wouldn’t be able to hide behind my body.
I wouldn’t be able to dominate my way out of being seen.
For the first time in years, desire felt dangerous.
For the first time, I wasn’t sure I was enough.
And God, I wanted to be.
I wanted to be enough for her (not my cock, not my stamina, not my perfect lighting angles).
Just me.
I typed back before I could talk myself out of it:
“Name the place.”

Chapter 5

I dressed like a man walking into the most important meeting of his life: a perfectly tailored charcoal three-piece suit, crisp white shirt, tie the color of midnight, everything cut close but not flashy. The jacket sat on my shoulders like armor I no longer needed, but I wore it anyway, because tonight I wanted to feel the weight of expectation and then let her strip it away. My hands were steady when I knotted the tie, but my pulse betrayed me, hammering against the starched collar.
Every step toward the café made my chest tighter, the city air too thick to breathe.
She was already there.
Corner table, low amber light, a single book balanced lightly between her long, elegant fingers like it belonged there. Eléa didn’t scan the room; she simply existed, and the second my eyes found her the rest of the world dissolved.
She was smaller than I’d imagined, sylphlike, all fluid lines and quiet gravity. Her outfit revealed just enough to intrigue — red boots, shorts, and a light white top that shifted with her movements, the fabric soft enough to hint at the discreet metal beneath. The faint outline of her nipple piercings pressed gently against the cloth, not provocative but intimate, a detail she didn’t hide, a sign of someone entirely at ease in her own skin.
Ink marked her body like fragments of a story: a tribal tattoo nestled between her shoulder blades, its sweeping lines evoking rebirth and resilience; tiny multicolored crystal orbs circling her wrist like captured droplets of light; and a cascade of flowers blooming over her left shoulder, delicate yet vibrant, adding color to her quiet strength.

And when she looked up (grey-green eyes shot through with flecks of molten gold, storm and sunlight in one devastating glance), they locked onto me with a steadiness that punched the air from my lungs. A half-smile hovered on her mouth, playful and ancient. Her nails: one hand matte black with white dots, the other pure white with black dots (yin and yang made visible, chess board made obvious).
I crossed the café like I was walking toward destiny, jacket open, tie suddenly feeling too tight.
We talked. Carefully at first, testing the air the way we’d tested words for weeks. My old reflexes kept trying to surface (lean in too far, drop my voice into that dominant register, take control). I caught myself every time. Stuttered once. Laughed nervously. Admitted I was terrified. She watched, amused, patient, letting me unravel.
I don’t remember leaving. I only remember the soft, final click of her apartment door shutting behind us (books, vanilla, sharp citrus, her).
The tension snapped the instant we were alone.
But it was different. The old fire coiled in my chest, the familiar surge in my cock straining against tailored wool, yet it was tempered by something sharper: the need to earn her, not just take.
She stepped close, fingers brushing the knot of my tie, then slowly loosening it.
“I want to see if you can pace yourself,” she whispered, lips brushing my ear. “Prove you can listen.”
I groaned, heat spiraling through me. “Anything,” I rasped. “Tell me.”
She smiled, slow and wicked, and began.
She undressed me with deliberate calm (jacket folded neatly over a chair, vest unbuttoned one slow button at a time, tie sliding free with a hiss of silk, shirt peeled away like she was unwrapping something sacred). When the last piece hit the floor she hummed, palms mapping my chest, shoulders, abs (never rushing lower). Every time I tried to pull her closer she pulled back with a soft, “Not yet. Make me earn it.”
Hours blurred into a slow, exquisite torture of touches, whispers, and commands.
She guided my hands over her body, showing me exactly where and how. When I finally peeled her top off and saw the silver bars up close, I nearly lost it.
“Eyes on me first,” she ordered, cupping my jaw. “Stay with me.”
I obeyed.
She edged me mercilessly (mouth, fingers, the slick heat between her thighs), bringing me to the brink and stopping until I was shaking, leaking, begging in broken whispers.
“Stop. Watch me. See what I do next,” she said, tilting her head with that sly smile.
I obeyed, and the restraint itself became its own kind of ecstasy.
Finally, when I was trembling with need, she breathed, “Now. Fuck me like you mean it. Show me everything you’ve got.”
But before I could move, she slid down my body, nails scraping lightly over the fine fabric still clinging to my hips.
“First, I’m going to taste you,” she purred, tongue wetting her lips.
She took me deep, throat constricting, eyes locked on mine.
“You like that, don’t you?” she murmured, pulling back to tease the head. “You like the way I suck your cock?”
“Fuck, Eléa… yes,” I groaned, hands tangling in her hair.
She hummed around me, took me deeper, then stopped right as my hips jerked.
“Not yet,” she whispered, cruel and perfect. “I want you to fuck me with that beautiful cock first.”
I followed her cues, sliding into her slow and deep, letting her set the rhythm.
“Yes, just like that,” she gasped, nails raking my back. “Don’t you dare stop. I want to feel every inch of you.”
I obeyed, hips pistoning, the room filling with the wet slap of our bodies.
“Harder,” she demanded, voice raw. “Fuck me harder. Make me feel it tomorrow.”
I gave her everything, driving deeper, until she shattered around me, crying out, walls pulsing.
Just when I thought she’d collapse, she pushed me flat.
“On your back,” she commanded, voice trembling with aftershocks.
She straddled me, sank down with a guttural moan.
“Now you’ll see what I can do,” she promised, eyes dark with lust.
She rode me fierce and primal, hips grinding, breasts bouncing, fingers on her clit.
“Look at me,” she ordered. “Watch me come all over your cock.”
I was mesmerized as she threw her head back and screamed, convulsing, flooding me.
She collapsed forward, trembling, then whispered against my lips, “I want your tongue on me. Eat my pussy until I scream.”
I flipped her gently, devoured her (sucking, licking, curling fingers inside until she bucked and came again, thighs clamped around my head).
When she finally pushed me away, breathless, she looked wrecked and triumphant.
“I want you to fuck my ass,” she whispered, voice ragged. “Every last inch. I want to feel you for days.”
I coated myself in her slick, pressed the head against her tight ring.
“Tell me you want it,” I growled, barely holding on.
“I want it,” she moaned, pushing back. “Give me all of you. Don’t hold back now.”
I entered her slowly, savoring the impossible heat, the grip.
“Fuck, you’re so tight,” I rasped.
“More,” she demanded, voice breaking. “I need more. Ruin me.”
I began to move (slow, then harder, deeper), until the room was nothing but obscene sounds and her broken pleas.
“Is this what you wanted?” I growled, slamming home.
“Yes,” she sobbed, meeting every thrust. “Don’t stop… please… I’m so close again…”
I reached around, fingers finding her clit, rubbing tight circles.
“Come for me one more time,” I commanded. “Come while I’m buried in your ass.”
She shattered with a scream, clenching so hard I saw stars, and I finally let go (pouring into her in long, pulsing waves, claiming every inch).
We collapsed, tangled, sweaty, trembling, hearts hammering against each other.
When the intensity finally ebbed, we lay entwined, breathing deep, bodies still tingling. Her fingers traced lazy patterns over my chest, nails scraping lightly.
“You see?” she murmured, voice a satisfied purr, eyes glowing in the half-dark. “It’s never been about how long you can last. It’s about how well you listen. How perfectly you respond.”
I laughed (breathless, stunned, reborn).
I had found my match (not just in body, but in mind, in spirit, in every way that mattered).
For the first time, my endless hunger wasn’t a curse.
With her, it was finally, perfectly, enough.

By the end of that first night with her, something cracked open inside me and let the light in.
I had survived without a single one of my usual weapons. No flexing, no dominance, no endless stamina used as proof. I had been nervous, clumsy, honest, vulnerable… and she had wanted me anyway. More than wanted: she had chosen me. For the first time in years I understood that desire could live somewhere deeper than muscle and skin, that intimacy could be grown in the mind and watered with truth. The ache was still there (God, it was always there), but it no longer ruled me. I had learned that the most important games aren’t won by force or size or endurance.
They’re won by showing up exactly as you are.
The real challenge had only just begun.
For days afterward I walked through the city lighter than I’d been in years. My body still hummed (anticipation, nerves, the memory of her eyes), but the hum felt like music instead of a curse. Eléa lingered in me like a rare perfume: sharp, unusual, impossible to ignore.

Chapter 6

On the third morning I woke in her bed after a night of slow conversation, shared silences, and small touches that trembled with meaning. She was in the shower; steam curled from the half-open bathroom door. The sheets smelled of monoi oil and her skin. Sunlight slid across the floorboards in quiet gold bars.
Out of pure habit (dangerous, stupid habit), I reached for my phone.
The light caught my torso the way it always had: a perfect diagonal across my ribs, shadow pooling under the curve of my chest. Reflex took over. I lifted the phone, adjusted the angle, flexed just enough. Click.
It was a beautiful photo. Of course it was.
I posted it before my brain caught up. Caption vague, atmospheric, suggestive (the kind that invited a thousand fantasies without giving away anything real).
Within minutes the notifications exploded. Fire emojis. Thirsty messages. Women I hadn’t spoken to in months sliding back into my DMs like nothing had changed.
It felt good for exactly four seconds.
Then it felt like poison.
I set the phone face-down and stared at the ceiling, heart suddenly heavy.
When Eléa came out of the shower (hair wrapped in a towel, wearing one of my discarded shirts that slipped off one tattooed shoulder), she looked radiant. She leaned down to kiss me, soft and slow. I kissed her back, tasting mint and warmth, something fragile fluttering in my chest.
Then her eyes flicked to the phone. The screen had lit up again.
My post was still open.
Her face didn’t harden. It cooled (just enough to freeze the air between us).
She didn’t say anything right away.
We drank coffee in a silence that wasn’t angry but wasn’t easy either. I told myself I was overthinking.
Hours later the message came.
“I liked waking up with you this morning.”
I smiled at the screen like an idiot.
Then the second part arrived.
“I didn’t like waking up and feeling like the night we shared was already being packaged for strangers.”
The words hit me like cold water.
A small, sharp fracture opened in my chest.
I called her immediately, voice thick.
“Are you angry?”
“No,” she said, soft and steady. “Just… careful.”
“Careful of what?”
“Careful of giving myself to someone who still gives himself away so easily.”
The tenderness in her tone hurt more than anger ever could.
We met that evening in the park near her building. She wore a long navy coat and a thick knitted scarf; mist clung to her hair like tiny diamonds. Her ashgold eyes were unreadable in the half-light.
“What you posted,” she said gently, “wasn’t wrong. It just made me feel… disposable. Like everything we’re building can be swallowed by your audience in seconds.”
“It wasn’t about us,” I said, too quickly.
“That’s exactly the problem,” she answered.
She looked away, jaw tightening for half a second — the first crack I’d ever seen in her composure.
“Sometimes I think you don’t want intimacy,” she said quietly, but the edge was unmistakable.
“You just want an audience that claps.”
The words hit harder than they should have.
Unfair.
Not entirely true.
But close enough to hurt.
Before I could answer, she exhaled, shook her head once, and started walking again — as if she already regretted saying it.
Finally she stopped under a streetlamp, hands buried in her pockets.
“I don’t want to be content,” she said quietly. “Not in the algorithmic sense. Not background scenery for your image. I want to be real for you (or nothing).”
It wasn’t an ultimatum.
It was a boundary, clear and clean and kind.
And in that moment, the fact that she could draw a line so calmly, speak her needs so precisely, made me want her more than I’d ever wanted anything. It steadied me. It grounded me. It lit me up from the inside.
That feeling stayed with me for days.
It rose again the afternoon we wandered through the Dalí exhibition at the modern art museum. She moved slowly between the melting clocks and impossible landscapes, her eyes tracing details no one else seemed to notice, lips brushing thoughtfully when something startled her. I watched her more than the paintings (the way she tilted her head, the quiet hum of concentration, the small, private smile when a canvas surprised her). We talked in low voices, teasing, challenging, laughing when I overthought some symbolism and she cut through it with one perfect sentence. It felt effortless and electric at once.
Our days became luminous (shared coffees in tiny bistros, long walks that turned into dinners without either of us noticing the hours slip away, nights spent discovering new ways to touch, to speak, to listen). Sometimes curiosity carried us straight from sunrise to sunrise.
I felt changed (quieter inside my own skin, calmer, happier). Our messages stopped being veiled seductions and became something softer, more real: a line from a book she loved, a voice note of her laughing at a ridiculous street sign, a photo of her at a tiny French-style restaurant with yesterday’s newspapers as tablecloths.
Then, slowly, almost imperceptibly, something shifted again.
I could feel it coming (the way you feel weather changing in your bones).

Chapter 7

It started with a canceled dinner.
“I’m buried under deadlines,” she texted. “Can we postpone?”
Of course I understood.
But something twisted hard in my chest all the same.
The next day her replies came hours late.
I sent her a long voice note about a thought we’d shared two nights earlier (something small that had felt huge in the dark). She answered with three words: “Yes, exactly that.”
By the end of the week the rhythm we’d fallen into (the one that had felt like breathing in sync) turned jagged. She wasn’t cold. She was just… elsewhere. Absorbed. Quiet.
For most people that wouldn’t be a crisis.
For me (someone who had lived on immediacy, on being wanted the second I reached out), it felt like someone had switched off the sun.
I caught myself checking my phone every thirty seconds.
Re-reading old messages like an addict.
Trying to decode pauses that probably meant nothing.
But to me those pauses screamed one thing:
She’s slipping away.
And I still don’t know how to exist if I’m not being watched.
On the sixth night I sat alone in my apartment, the silence pressing in from every corner. Out of nowhere I opened the private folder on my phone (the one I hadn’t touched since I met her). Old videos. The ones where I looked invincible. Powerful. Intoxicating. The version of me that had kept loneliness at bay for years.
My hands shook.
I turned on the camera.
It was pure reflex (muscle memory deeper than thought). I propped the phone against a stack of books, red light blinking like it was hungry. I ran a hand through my hair, let it fall across my forehead the way I knew looked best. My hips started moving before my brain caught up (slow, deliberate rolls I could do blindfolded). The thin grey sweats did nothing to hide how thick I was, how obviously the fabric strained when I got hard. I dragged the waistband down, let them pool at my ankles, stood naked in front of the lens. Not fully hard yet, but heavy, impressive, resting against my thigh like a promise.
I wrapped my hand around myself and stroked slow at first (lazy, teasing, the way thousands had begged to watch). Then something snapped. The performance cracked open into something rawer. My hips snapped forward, violent, desperate thrusts into empty air. I wasn’t seducing an audience anymore; I was trying to prove to myself I still existed. Each pump of my fist was brutal, punishing, the muscles in my thighs and abs standing out sharp under the low light. A low growl tore out of me (the only sound in the room except skin on skin). Head thrown back, neck corded, I fucked my own hand like it was the last thing tethering me to the planet. When I came it was sudden and harsh (thick ropes striping my stomach and chest, hips jerking forward one final time, a broken groan echoing off the walls).
I watched the clip once.
It was perfect.
It was devastating.
I edited it anyway (trimmed the shaky start, added the filter that made my skin glow like bronze). A reminder of who I used to be. Proof I was still magnetic.
I posted it.
The response was instant (hundreds of likes in minutes, DMs flooding, the old familiar high rushing through my veins like a drug).
It felt incredible.
Then it felt like swallowing broken glass.
I lay back on the couch, phone buzzing itself silly on the table, and felt the betrayal sink into my bones. Not just of Eléa. Of myself.

Chapter 8

The next morning her message came.
No greeting.
No warmth.
Just a single line, gentle and merciless:
“I saw your video.
You don’t have to choose me.
But you have to choose which version of yourself you want to keep feeding.”
I typed replies and deleted them for an hour.
What could I possibly say?
That I panicked?
That silence still feels like dying?
That I’m terrified I only exist when someone’s watching?
An hour later she wrote again:
“I’m here.
But not if you keep running back to who you were before.”
Then came days of near-silence (not cruel, just distance). A distance that closed the walls of my old life around me like a coffin.
The compliments on the relapse video turned to ash in my mouth. My phone never stopped buzzing, but none of it reached me. It was noise.
One sleepless night I opened Instagram again and stared at my own profile (a shrine to hunger and perfection, every thumbnail a version of me that suddenly looked like a stranger screaming for attention).
It was unbearably loud.
I switched on the front-facing camera.
No oil. No posing. No perfect light.
Just me on the edge of my bed, morning light harsh and honest.
I recorded a short clip (quiet, unsteady, real):
“You’ve seen my body in every possible way.
You’ve never seen me tired of it.
I’m done performing.
Not for anyone else.
For me.”
I posted it, then archived every old video I could bear to lose.
Not to win her back.
Because I finally wanted to breathe without an audience.
I slept for twelve hours straight (the deepest sleep I’d had in years).
The next morning her message was long (the longest in weeks).

Chapter 9

She told me she’d watched the new video three times.
That my rawness unsettled her (not because it was weak, but because it asked her to be raw too).
That she had pulled away because she was terrified of mattering too much, of losing the protective distance she’d always kept.
Her last line:
“If you want to talk (really talk), I’ll be at our café tomorrow at 10.”
I arrived twenty minutes early, heart in my throat.
She was already there, reading, ashgold eyes calm over the top of her book.
When she looked up there was no mask, no test, no armor.
We spoke quietly, honestly, painfully.
I told her about the panic, the emptiness of the likes, the way silence still feels like drowning sometimes.
I didn’t promise I’d never relapse.
I promised I’d never again use what we have to feed the void.
“I can’t swear the hunger will disappear,” I said, voice rough. “But I swear I’ll never let it touch us again.”
She listened, fingers wrapped around her cup.
“I can’t promise I won’t overthink,” she said softly. “But I can promise to stay, even when I’m scared.”
“And I shouldn’t have said that thing about you wanting an audience.
That was me speaking from fear, not truth.”
Silence settled between us (warm, for the first time in weeks).
I placed my phone on the table, face-down, notifications muted.
She reached for it, opened the camera, aimed it at our two coffees and our hands (almost, but not quite, touching).
Click.
She saved the photo. Didn’t post it.
“This one is just for us,” she said.
Something inside me that had been clenched for years finally let go.
For the first time, I didn’t need a thousand eyes to feel real.
I only needed hers, looking at me like I was already enough. 


The end.
